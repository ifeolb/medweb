** Background:

This Button2Web Project initially started with a raspberry pi Button. However, it took a turn when it was brought to my attention that I actually did not need a button at all. I could simply create a check-in form that emails the information to the correct destination. This is demonstrated on the webserver I created using Github Pages. 

*Medical Place, a made-up healthcare facility can now do virtual check ins! No long lines, wait, or even unnecessary contact. Check in from the comfort of your own personal device and wait for your name to be called. Thatâ€™s it!*
